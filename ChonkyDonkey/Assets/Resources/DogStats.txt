2	Kiefy	TRUE	Woof. (Kiefy is looking you up and down disdainfully)	Hm, it might be nice to get to know you better.	You look like a dog that would take my toys.	The snacks here are really good. Have you tried any of them yet?	That one is pretty good! The rawhide is my favorite!	Eh, that one is okay, but there is better stuff for sure.	Which do you prefer more? Going on walks or playing with your toys?	I don’t think I have a favorite. I like both of them so much!	You know, it’s important to play with your human daily or they get sad.	What’s my favorite toy? I like bones! They’re tasty and fun to chew!	Yeah you’re right, all toys are pretty fun!	Oh, well I like things other than bones too…	We should go to the park together sometime!	I’m so excited! We can chase the squirrels together!	Oh, that’s ok, the park isn’t for every dog…
3	Nuggie	TRUE	Um…hi…can I help you?	It’s…nice to meet you. I’m Nuggie.	…	I…uh…recently opened a store in town. Nevermind, you’re probably not interested...	You are!? I think that’s a first…	Yeah, I guess it’s not super fun to talk about work after hours.	What kind of store do I run? Oh…a flower shop!	You smell as nice as my flowers!	Maybe it wasn’t such a great idea after all.	I’ll let you in on a little secret! My favorite thing to do is lick blankets hehe~	No way! You too? The fabric just feels so nice to lick!	Oh, you think it’s weird…?	Would you like to come over and watch a movie sometime?	We can even share my blanket~	Maybe some other time…
4	Beeg bb	TRUE	You can call me Beeg bb, but I'm sure you’ve heard of me and all the great things I’ve dug up.	I dug up that old squeaky toy they had on display at the inn last year!	You haven’t? Huh…	I’m back in town for the mines. I’ve heard they got bones bigger than me down there and I’m gonna find ‘em!	I know I will because I’m the best miner there is!	You don’t believe me!?	My human can’t stop singin’ this “Chrissy stop sleepin’” song. She’s overplayed it so it’s gettin’ on my nerves now.	Ugh, yours too? Looks like we got somethin’ in common!	You uh…you like it?	I could really go for some peanut butter right now.	PB is the best treat! I always take some on my digs.	Your human puts medicine in it? That’s playin’ dirty…	So, when I find that giant bone…would you like to share it with me?	I can’t wait!	Right, I’m sure you’re plenty busy.
